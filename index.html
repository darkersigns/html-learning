<h1>This is a heading using the H1 tag</h1>
<h2>This is a heading using the H2 tag</h2>
<h3>This is a heading using the H3 tag</h3>

<p>This is a paragraph contained within the P tag. Probably best to space these bad boys out. Wouldn't wanna overload people!</p>

<!--The (alt) tag is used to give a description of a tag. Example given is screen readers can read the alt tag (blind people)-->

<p>This is an example of two paragraphs right after eachother with no break (br tag) between them</p>
<p>Here is the second paragraph. How nasty...</p>

<p>How pretty!</p>

<p style="color:red">This should be a paragraph of red text. Fucking whoopie! Remember, you define the style you want in the opening tag of an element. Style first, substance second. HTML is very shallow... </p>
<!--Seems you can't use real English here...COLOR instead of colour. Worth noting that to write in HTML I will need to remove a few braincells...-->


<p title="Tooltip magic with titles! They said it couldn't be done...">A paragraph with a hoverable tooltip. Fucking. Magic.</p>

<p title="Explaining the use of `quotes`">So the tooltip for this paragraph shows how to use both single and double quotes to both define an attribute and display a piece of quoted text. Never know...</p>

<h1 style="font-size:60px; color:darkorange">A little something about headings</h1>
<p>So there are 6 levels of heading tag to use. H1-H6. These will pretty much give a little indent and a bump to font size, but as ya can see from the heading of this section, with a bit of styling, anything can be a heading! Check it out</p>

<h1 style="color:lavender;">Let's have a break</h1>
<hr/>
<p>So what you see right there is a HR tag. According to W3 it defines a thematic break in a HTML page. According to me, it's a line across the screen that acts as a visible break. Why they gotta make it sound so fancy? Code is lying down is all. Christ...Also, the colour (NOT COLOR FUCK YOU AMERICA!) used for the heading here was Lavender. LAVENDER. Half chub...</p>
