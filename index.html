<h1 id="top_of_page">This is a heading using the H1 tag</h1>
<h2>This is a heading using the H2 tag</h2>
<h3>This is a heading using the H3 tag</h3>

<p>This is a paragraph contained within the P tag. Probably best to space these bad boys out. Wouldn't wanna overload people!</p>

<!--The (alt) tag is used to give a description of a tag. Example given is screen readers can read the alt tag (blind people)-->

<p>This is an example of two paragraphs right after eachother with no break (br tag) between them</p>
<p>Here is the second paragraph. How nasty...</p>

<p>This is an example of two paragraphs with a break between them</p>
<br/>
<p>How pretty!</p>

<p style="color:red">This should be a paragraph of red text. Fucking whoopie! Remember, you define the style you want in the opening tag of an element. Style first, substance second. HTML is very shallow... </p>
<!--Seems you can't use real English here...COLOR instead of colour. Worth noting that to write in HTML I will need to remove a few braincells...-->


<p title="Tooltip magic with titles! They said it couldn't be done...">A paragraph with a hoverable tooltip. Fucking. Magic.</p>

<p title="Explaining the use of `quotes`">So the tooltip for this paragraph shows how to use both single and double quotes to both define an attribute and display a piece of quoted text. Never know...</p>

<h1 style="font-size:60px; color:darkorange">A little something about headings</h1>
<p>So there are 6 levels of heading tag to use. H1-H6. These will pretty much give a little indent and a bump to font size, but as ya can see from the heading of this section, with a bit of styling, anything can be a heading! Check it out</p>
<p style="font-size:90px;">This is not a heading. Isn't that crazy?</p>

<h1 style="color:lavender;">Let's have a break</h1>
<hr/>
<p>So what you see right there is a HR tag. According to W3 it defines a thematic break in a HTML page. According to me, it's a line across the screen that acts as a visible break. Why they gotta make it sound so fancy? Code is lying down is all. Christ...Also, the colour (NOT COLOR FUCK YOU AMERICA!) used for the heading here was Lavender. LAVENDER. Half chub...</p>

<h1 style="color:greenyellow;">Check out my whitespace</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph with correct grammatical rules. There are proper spaces between words, commas where there should be and no crazy chunks of nothing.</p>
<p>This paragraph
is kind of a mess. There                         are spaces everywhere
and it's spread across three or 4
lines. Doesn't matter in the browser though. Clever son of a bitch this HTML</p>

<pre style="font-size:17px; color:darkcyan;">Let's talk about the pre tag
    Using the pre tag
    Will preserve spacing
    Between lines and line breaks
    Think of all the poems you could write with this badboy!
</pre>

<h1 style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS', serif;">This heading has been changed to use Comic Sans. The cardinal sin...</h1>
<p style="font-family:'Calibri', serif; font-size:130%; color:saddlebrown;">This paragraph aimed to fix that. I don't think it was all that successful...Something interesting to note though is that you can change the size of the font to a percentage aswell as a pixel size. That's kinda cool!</p>
<!--Apparently it's a good idea to have a fallback font if the first should fail to load. So the second font is the fallback.-->

<p style="text-align:center;">Chose your alignment!</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Choose wisely</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">The last guy chose...poorly</p>

<h1>HTML Formatting elements</h1>

<p>So here is a list of some formats you can use for making text look different:</p>

<ul>
    <li> (b) - Bold text </li>
    <li> (strong) - Important text </li>
    <li> (i) - Italic text </li>
    <li> (em) - Emphasized text </li>
    <li> (mark) - Marked text </li>
    <li> (small) - Small text </li>
    <li> (del) - Deleted text </li>
    <li> (ins) - Inserted text </li>
    <li> (sub) - Subscript text </li>
    <li> (sup) - Superscript text </li>
</ul>

<p><b>This text is bold. It regularly asks the pretty girls out</b></p>
<p><strong>This text is strong. It regularly lifts logs for the pretty girls</strong></p>
<p>Browsers will display both the same but the tag gives a difference in importance. The same is true for <i>Italic</i> & <em>Emphasised</em> text. Probably not important but might aswell make a note here...</p>

<p>Let's see how many different formats we can squeeze into one small, tight, narrow paragraph</p>
<!--Mind clearly wandered a bit there lewy.-->
<!--TODO Plan A-->
<p>Here is some <small>text</small>. This text is <mark>highlighted</mark>. Incase you ever want to make a point of showing what you deleted, you can <del>go with</del> use the del tag. For when something really
    needs emphasising you can <ins>insert</ins> it. For the times you want to make your text look stupid you can <sub>subscript</sub> or <sup>superscript</sup> it. Yeah, that's not gonna annoy anyone...</p>

<a href="full_background.html"><button>This will link you to a different page that uses an image as a background.</button> </a>

<p> A wise man once said <q>Go to bed with itchy bum; wake up with smelly finger</q></p>

<p>So this is me trying a blockquote from a random website. Three guesses where it came from...</p>
<blockquote cite="nothingfunky.com" style="color:royalblue;"><em>So here is where you could put the quoted text. I suppose you would pick the relevant bit but link to the whole page in the citation.</em> </blockquote>

<p>So here we're gonna try out using the abbreviation attribute. <abbr title="Mother I'd Like to Fondle">MILF</abbr> is of course a well known abbreviation. You're welcome future me.</p>

<p><cite>A phone background I found on the internet</cite> by Random Dude on Facebook, 2018</p>

<bdo dir="rtl">Just feels wrong</bdo>
<!--Probably no need to remember this one. Just fucking stupid-->

<p style="background-color:yellow; color: mediumvioletred; border:9px solid saddlebrown;">Adding some colour to our paragraphs!</p>

<p class="special_paragraph"> This paragraph is special. It has CSS styling. Everybody hates this paragraph but he looks spiffy AF!</p>

<a href="#top_of_page">This will take you to the top of the page. There is no way back from this...</a>
